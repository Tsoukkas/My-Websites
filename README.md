Project Page: All the websites have a home page, project page (is a page that has a description about the project that the website is about).
PartnersL After that we can see a page that is called partners and there we can see five or six and sometimes more organizations with different background that are collaborating for the project.
Result/Resources: There you can see the workpages of the project and all the material that the project can give to the users of the webpage. Many times is educational material or something similar. The educational material is builded with learndash lms and h5p content sometimes.It includes videos, pdfs, and quizes. Sometimes we can see the certificates in the end.
Contact Us: Is a page with a contact us form that is builded with ninja forms, or wpforms and it requires many times the name,email, massage/comment of the user and the administrator(project manager) of the project is recieving an email with these description to contact them about anything that is related to the project.
